### Enhancements
  - Added Support for Camel 4.0 Framework

## Installation

To install:

1. Download the latest release jar files.
2. In the New Relic Java directory (the one containing newrelic.jar), create a directory named extensions if it does not already exist.
3. Copy the downloaded jars into the extensions directory.
4. Restart the application.   

## Java 17 Support

To ensure compatibility with Java 17, please use New Relic Java Agent version 7.4.0 or higher.
If you're not using Java 17, you can safely remove camel-core-jms-4.0.0.jar from the extensions directory.
Failure to follow these recommendations may lead to application crashes.
